## General Information
- Multiple linear regression is performed on the dataset.
- The project is done as part of coursework from IIIT-Bangalore. 
- We are trying to find the number of rentals issued from the company based on numerous independent values such as temperature, weather, humidity, holiday, etc. 
- The Boombikes bike rental dataset is being used. 

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- The R-squared value of the train set is 83.6% whereas the test set has a value of 80.4% which suggests that our model broadly explains the variance quite accurately on the test set and thus we can conclude that it is a good model.
- The training and testing datasets which suggests that the variance is accurately predicted on the test set. The p-values and VIF were used to select the significant variables. RFE was also conducted for automated selection of variables.
